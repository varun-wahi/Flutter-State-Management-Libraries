# State Management Learning App

A Flutter project where I learnt about differnt State Management Solutions by implemententation:
  1. Riverpod
  2. Bloc
  3. Cubit

I've made a counter application and a API fetcher application using EACH solution.

You can easily download the apk file from the root directory. It's called  "app-release.apk"
